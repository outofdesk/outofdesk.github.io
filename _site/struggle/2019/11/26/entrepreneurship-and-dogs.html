<div class="content">
  <div class="post"><p>In 2013, I was working in a startup with a team of about 10 engineers when one day we were all called for a team meeting. The founders were in the meeting so we knew it was something important. We were informed that the company was shutting down due to lack of funding.</p>

<p>I had received admit a few days ago from one of the graduate schools I had applied to in the US and so I had a plan and two to three months of vacation ahead. One of the senior engineers in the team decided to work on his venture. Other people started looking for jobs, some founded their own companies too. He asked me if I would be willing to work with him to help build a Proof of Concept(POC). I had nothing to lose here. If it went well, I could always stay and potentially become a co-founder(yes, I passed that opportunity to go to graduate school!) or I could fly to the US in a few months and begin another new phase. It was a win-win for me.</p>

<p>He said he had savings to afford not having a job for up to a year and he knew a couple of people who could potentially invest in his idea. After we built the POC, we drove around to places on his motorbike, with our laptops and a “tea-and-biscuits” pitch.</p>

<p>One day after we parked the bike, he looked at a street dog sleeping on the road and told me something in Hindi(translated to English here): “We should have been born as those fucking street dogs. Didn’t have to worry so much about jobs or founding a company! We could just sleep all day.” That to me was hilarious. Something about his tone, his facial expression, the casual delivery and the humor about his struggle made it really funny.</p>

<p>I think back on it and that episode seems profound.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>It tells something about human desire and imagination</em> - How we always seek meaning in our lives, how we have this power to create something new, and even the audacity to imagine what a dog’s life must be like!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>It tells about the attitude one can have even in difficult situations in life</em> - The fact that he said that signals his frustration and anxiety, but also his attitude to make something funny out of it, rather than brooding over the situation and do nothing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>It tells something about the stories, sometimes false narratives we tell ourselves to get through life, our ability to see the “grass as always greener on the other side”</em> - How we think others’ lives are easy, and that it would be so much better if we could trade their lives with ours. We only look at tiny slices of someone’s life and simplify them to make ourselves feel better.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>The <strong>drive</strong> that almost robs us of free will and calls the shots in our lives</em> - His wife was pregnant at the time and was staying with her parents, so he had a couple of months to devote himself to something. He had enough money to take a vacation, but he chose (or was forced by his drive) to struggle, and to push himself to embark on a new and unknown journey.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>He pivoted from the original idea that we had worked on but his company received a couple of rounds of funding and seems to be doing well now. So I guess he has moved on to define some new struggles and goals for himself to chase, as we always do.</p>
