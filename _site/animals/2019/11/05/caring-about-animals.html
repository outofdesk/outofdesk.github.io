  <div class="post"><blockquote>
We tried to explain that we were interested in the prevention of suffering and misery; that we were opposed to arbitrary discrimination; that we thought it wrong to inflict needless suffering on another being, even if that being were not a member of our own species; and that we believed animals were ruthlessly and cruelly exploited by humans, and we wanted this changed. Otherwise, we said, we were not especially “interested in” animals.

<p><cite>Peter Singer, in Animal Liberation: The Definitive Classic of the Animal Movement</cite></p>

<hr />

<p>I’ve often felt out of place in vegan and animal welfare circles where people name the rescued animals, celebrate their birthdays, make them desserts and kiss them on their mouths. In that sense, I’m not an animal lover. I deeply care about animals, a bit more than I care about humans I’d say and I can’t stand abuse or violence against them. I have cried just reading accounts of the treatment of animals for meat and fashion.</p>

<p>I remember one time in fifth grade, right in front of my home, a few stray dogs had brutally injured a baby pig. The dogs neither killed nor ate its flesh. They injured it enough that it couldn’t move. If you’ve ever heard the noise of a pig squealing, you know it’s not a pleasant one. I cried my heart out and skipped school that day because I couldn’t step out of the door. It was a slow, painful death, for the pig and some tiny part of me.</p>

<p>I’m also very sensitive to the blood of animals. I can’t see it. I’d probably faint if I saw an injured animal up close, bleeding. So, while I am hopelessly emotional about them, I also can’t help if I ever saw a bloodily injured animal, unless somebody forced me to do it, or showed me how to do it right because I can’t see blood on animals and I’m scared of inadvertently intensifying their pain.</p>

<p>But while reading Animal Liberation, a classic by Peter Singer, I realized that you don’t have to be an animal lover to care about them and to believe in their moral and ethical treatment. You don’t have to love or have to have even met an african-american in your life, to ideologically believe that slavery and racial discrimination in any form are immoral and wrong. So why expect that a person should be an animal lover to believe in animal welfare, autonomy, and rights?</p>

<p>I’d probably never own a pet again. But that shouldn’t stop me from thinking about animal welfare. It’s not an inconsistency. The fundamental shift in thinking comes from a belief that non-human animals are not that different from us, and acknowledge, what’s now proved beyond doubt, that they experience pain and suffering very much like us. Once that’s established, other arguments start to make sense.</p>

<p>When we get into an argument or debate about this issue with others, it’s not so much about those animals as much as it’s about the moral values, prejudices, and biases we hold so dear. And that’s why it reaches the level of intensity it does and gets the kind of emotional, irrational responses that it gets. People often think that vegans and animal welfare activists ride on moral high grounds. One argument to that is that people who sense that arrogance in others, might have a deep, latent insecurity about themselves being inconsistent and illogical on a certain level. And another is that even if people who care about animals aren’t on higher ground, they are surely not on lower ground.</p>

<p>Note to myself for next time I discuss this issue with someone.</p>

<p><em>Ask them fundamental questions about how they view animals, to begin with. If they believe that non-human animals are inferior in any sense, it’s that part you have to debate about, before even getting to how cruelly animals are treated.</em></p>
