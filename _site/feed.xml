        <title>Fight for Time</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
But I soon came to feel that teaching these sensitive young souls Latin and mathematics was cheating them of something far more essential — what they needed wasn’t dry information but hope, the kind that comes from being transported into a dream-world of possibility.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Helen Fagin, in The Velocity of Being: Letters to a Young Reader&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always felt at peace reading a book in a quiet place. I feel energized and excited to get to places where reading takes me. That feeling of getting inundated with ideas, freeing yourself from the constraints and conditioning of the real-world and letting your mind escape into a world of infinite potential and possibilities, asking yourself big questions and looking for answers within, is hugely inspiring and empowering. In that space and time, you’re neither in auto-pilot, nor in the passenger seat. You’re the one in complete control. Making wrong moves there or taking a wrong turn doesn’t come with the judgments and repercussions of the real world. Instead it comes with a deeper understanding of the consequences and rewards of your choices and helps you navigate the real world better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I feel like it’s much harder these days to get that lone space and time, harder than it needs to be. The eight or so hours that you spend at work is flooded with frequent and sometimes unnecessary meetings, direct or indirect conversations and breaks. You go home, spend some time with your partner, and eke out some time to read, write and workout. Not only do you have to carve time out for deep work, but also have to make an extra effort to quell the mental chatter caused by entropy throughout the day. With the open-floor plans in offices now, the passive conversations that you become of part of just by being there feels like passive smoking to me. You didn’t choose to involve in it, but will inevitably bear the brunt of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it always is an ongoing battle to make time for things, the process of fighting for it also tells you the things you value most, the things you consider are worth your time and that clarity and self-awareness will eventually force you to let go of the clutter.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My First Ultra</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After a long bike ride in July up in Colorado, I took it easy for a while and didn’t have any immediate goals to pursue. Had a couple of trips planned with my wife and some day hikes
during the weekends, but that’s about it. I was turning 30 in October and a random goal popped in my mind - to run at least 30 miles. The shortest official distance
that meets the criterion is 50k, which is about 32 miles. The longest I had run so far was a 35k the year before, which is about 22.5 miles. So it looked like an ambitious, formidable, yet doable challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was past the Labor Day weekend, so I had already lost the first week of September and since I wanted to do the race in the same month as my birthday, I had about 6-7 weeks to train. It seemed like a short time to go from 0 miles of running the whole year to 50k in a stretch, so I had to start as soon as possible. I started the week after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the training looked like in numbers. If you’re into long-distance running, you can tell that it looks like casual, weekday runs, nothing like training for an ultra at all. It’s true. Having made plans for the weekends ahead with my family and friends, weekdays were all I could get. Tried to squeeze at least two runs per week, mostly somewhere between 5-8 miles during lunch. The longest run was about 10.5 mi and that was three weeks before the race. Sometimes due to lack of time, and sometimes because of my own laziness, I
didn’t go longer than that. And those long runs were on flat roads, so I wasn’t getting any elevation training either. The race had about 5k ft of gain and descent. The thought of that in addition to pounding the legs for that long, scared me. The last two weeks I ventured out to hilly blocks in the city around my workplace and did some circuit runs to get my body(legs and glutes especially) used to uphills and downhills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes-and-reflections&quot;&gt;Notes and Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The race had a no-cup policy, so I carried a Nathan water bottle with me in hand. I think that works better for me than carrying a hydration pack, which rubs my back and gets the shirt all wet&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chafing is the worst. Even now, days after the race, my nipples hurt just thinking about it. I think right around mile 13, I took off my shirt and carried it pretty much from there up to a few yards before the finish line. I should take better care of it next time! Vaseline helps I think but I should look into some strap that hugs it tight and doesn’t cause friction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next time I sign up for something like this, I should do longer runs and on trails. That takes care of the boredom of long runs and also makes for a better training&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t get bored in trail runs. I had prepared a playlist of workout music and motivating podcasts to keep me going, especially in the end. But one, I didn’t need it and two, it ruins the fun of the race. When I slowed down in the last third of the race, I enjoyed the company of runners who were with me. Chatting with them, running with them helped me even speed up a little.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GU is delicious and works well, I think. It’s really easy to eat on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
