I enjoy reading books, long, well-thought-out articles and listening to long conversations about the topics that interest me. Most of the podcasts I listen to are free-form conversations that last anywhere between one to three hours.

Here's the list of things that I've enjoyed reading and/or listening.

    <blockquote>We're retelling it because Jamal Khashoggi's story should be heard in full. And because even if you think you know what happened, you may not know how or why.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>But I soon came to feel that teaching these sensitive young souls Latin and mathematics was cheating them of something far more essential — what they needed wasn’t dry information but hope, the kind that comes from being transported into a dream-world of possibility.</blockquote>

    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html">Life is Short</a> &raquo; <i><span>{{ "2019-11-03 00:18:23 +0700" | date_to_string }}</span></i>
    <blockquote>If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by surprise. And that is just what tends to happen. You take things for granted, and then they're gone. You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. The saddest windows close when other people die.</blockquote>
