Kids love toys. There's something innate about them that's often hard to point out about what makes particular toys desirable. We like to believe that we give up toys as we grow up. But that's hardly true; we merely start playing more refined games, with more sophisticated toys. One thing that's common between kids and adults is that we seldom think about the need or utility of toys. Kids can't reason about it, and adults don't. Those desires come from a more primitive part of the brain. I've not, until today, thought much about what we mean by being mature. It might mean different things to people, but an important part of maturing, it seems to me, is our ability to reason about our feelings and behavior. That's why we label people as child-like, or immature, when they act like free spirits, doing things in a carefree way, the connotation being that they don't think through things or that their choices don't seem rational. While it's good to be like that at times, in some form and fashion, it has its problems too.

In the world of software, tools, frameworks, and patterns are toys. Freshly minted engineers, like kids, are enamored by the world of infinite choices. They focus more on exploring the choices available than on their utility. Part of evolving as an engineer is to start seeing technology as a means to solve real-world problems rather than as an end in itself.

In my first job after college I worked as a frontend engineer, tasked with building web and mobile apps. Building user interfaces was not what I had in mind when I thought about putting my knowledge and skills in Computer Science into use. But as I grew more familiar with it, I came to love it more. I liked being able to see the product I was building as I was building it, and to see it from the lens of the customer. The field was also more dynamic than the backend ecosystem at the time. New frameworks and tools sprung up every day and like a kid who’s handed new toys, I enjoyed tinkering with them. Anything that was deemed cool drew my attention. My age and experience working in technology matched the age and maturity of the domain of frontend engineering itself. As mentioned in [this post](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2013/01/ecosystems.html), frontend engineering was accelerating in the phase of *innovation* while the backend industry was cruising in *commoditization*.

I then went to graduate school, to study more of what I hadn't used in my job. After school I got back into frontend engineering, to do more of what I didn't learn in grad school! I don't say that with the slightest of regret or guilt. It has taught me things that I would have otherwise never learned, most important of all, empathy for designers and front-end engineers, which is rare from what I see. The realm of frontend engineering was markedly different relative to what it had been two years ago. In the time I did my Master's, MVC frameworks in the browser gave way to reactive, event-driven systems. After a few more years of building user experiences at scale, I finally felt exhausted by the constant need to catch up with the trends of the industry. We spent more time getting consensus on the tools and frameworks rather than on the problems worth solving. Backend engineering, at least from my vantage point, seemed like a more reasonable, a more stable, place. So I switched my focus to backend engineering a few years ago and have been more at peace since.

A similar change happened fairly recently when engineering challenges grabbed less of my attention than the nontechnical aspects of the work we do -- people, principles, and processes. I like to call them "the three Ps". So I made the switch to explore and grow as a manager and as a leader. To be an engineer is to focus on how to build good systems; to be a technologist is to also care about the what and the why of building systems using technology. It has become clear to me in the last couple of years that laying out the purpose and focusing on “the three Ps” organically leads to better engineering practices and solutions.

These changes of perspectives and desires perhaps say something about my maturing as an engineer, a technologist, and a human. I'm not suggesting that any one role or domain is more mature than the other but that the ability to reflect and reevaluate, to be more aware of what drives you, is a quality that hints at your maturity.
