<blockquote>
We tried to explain that we were interested in the prevention of suffering and misery; that we were opposed to arbitrary discrimination; that we thought it wrong to inflict needless suffering on another being, even if that being were not a member of our own species; and that we believed animals were ruthlessly and cruelly exploited by humans, and we wanted this changed. Otherwise, we said, we were not especially “interested in” animals.

There are a million things to care about in this world if we cared to care about -- things that we know are systematically unfair, unjust or outright wrong. But if we cared about all of them to a point where we wanted to fix them or be a part of the solution, we’d go crazy. One way to maintain sanity is to accept that there are going to be things that are and will be out of our control and to learn to let go of some. That leaves us with time and energy to think about what we value the most and work towards fixing them, in any way and capacity we can. Elon Musk might be a rare exception, or at least the most popular of them out there, who can not only think about but make a huge impact on solving a lot of the pressing issues in the world today. But to make my point, even he is not consciously and primarily working towards fixing let’s say the gun violence in America or the use of social media for disrupting elections and attempts to shake the institution of democracy. Most often, people care about a lot of things, but in varying degrees.

I care a lot about my autonomy and growth, health and fitness, to an extent where I spend a considerable amount of my time and energy learning about them, experimenting with them and optimizing them. I also care about the environment and animal welfare but to a point where I don't proactively do a whole lot to cause any actual change, but I keep myself constantly educating about them and do the best I can without going above and beyond.

Having been brought up a vegetarian my entire life because of religious beliefs, I neither questioned nor observed any inconsistencies in the foods we consumed and the stories we told ourselves about them. I always cared about animals and after reading about and watching the horrors of the dairy industry, I finally decided to give up dairy and egg and go vegan. It wasn't easy in the beginning, but it happened at once when the evidence of the ill-effects of dairy, on my health and animals, was too clear and overwhelming to ignore.

But I've often felt out of place in vegan and animal welfare circles where people name the rescued animals, celebrate their birthdays, make them desserts and kiss them on their mouths. In that sense, I'm not an animal lover. I deeply care about animals, a bit more than I care about humans I'd say, and I can't stand abuse or violence against them. I have cried just reading accounts of the treatment of animals for meat and fashion. I remember one time in fifth grade, right in front of my home, a few stray dogs had brutally injured a baby pig. The dogs neither killed nor ate its flesh. They injured it enough that it couldn't move. If you've ever heard the noise of a pig squealing, you know it's not a pleasant one. I cried my heart out and skipped school that day because I couldn't step out of the door. It was a slow, painful death, for the pig and some tiny part of me.

I'm also very sensitive to the blood of animals. I can't see it. I'd probably faint if I saw an injured animal up close, bleeding. So, while I am hopelessly emotional about animals, I'm not mentally tough enough to help one, bloodily injured.

But while reading *Animal Liberation*, a classic by Peter Singer, I realized that you don't have to love animals to care about them and to believe in their moral rights and ethical treatment. You don't have to have loved or even met a person in your life who has been a victim of some kind of discrimination, to ideologically believe that discrimination in any form - racial, sexual, intellectual - is immoral and wrong. So why expect that a person should love animals to believe in their welfare, autonomy, and rights?

I'd probably never own a pet, again. But that shouldn't necessarily stop me from thinking or talking about animal welfare. It's not an inconsistency, it's irrelevant. Similarly, owning a pet doesn't tell much about the extent to which a person cares about animals in general. The fundamental shift in thinking comes from a belief that non-human animals are not that different from us, and acknowledge, what's now proved beyond doubt, that they experience pain and suffering very much like us. Once that's established, other arguments start to make sense.

When we get into a debate about this with others, it's not so much about those animals as much as it's about the moral values, prejudices, and biases we hold so dear. That's why it reaches the level of intensity it does and gets the kind of emotional, sometimes irrational responses that it gets. It's seeing the belief system collapse, or being shown the inconsistency and hypocrisy in what we think and do that gets to us. People often think that vegans and animal welfare activists ride on moral high ground. One argument to that is that people who sense that arrogance or superiority in others, might have a deep, latent insecurity about their own beliefs on a certain level. Another is that even if people who care about animals aren't on higher ground, they are not on the lower ground either.

The next time you get into a discussion about this with someone with a different opinion, thinking of the following things might help to have a productive and sane debate.

- *Do they think non-human animals are inferior to humans? If they do, on what grounds?*
- *Do they think animals experience pain and suffering?*
- *Do they believe torture and killing of some animals is different than others?*
- *Do they know about the practices or treatment of animals being killed for meat and fashion?*
- *Do they think that their preferences and likes matter more than lives of animals?*

From answers to these, you'll know where they stand, and how likely they are to listen and understand your point of view. And if you can't do a good job communicating your arguments, just ask them to read *Animal Liberation*. No matter what their argument is, I'm sure Peter Singer will have a better, more convincing one.
