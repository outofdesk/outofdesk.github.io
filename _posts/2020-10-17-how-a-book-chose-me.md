While dragging my fingers against the iPad screen, browsing for available e-books in my digital library app, I stumbled upon a book called "How to Teach Philosophy to Your Dog - Exploring the Big Questions in Life", by Anthony McGowan.

The title piqued my interest for two reasons: first, because of my interest in Philosophy and in materials that break down complex subjects into simple language, and second, because I was curious about how ideas from a subject, as complex and as subjective as Philosophy, could possibly be transported out of the realm of human understanding and made chewable to a dog, hypothetically.

But those weren't the only reasons why I picked the book. The title triggered a memory of the first time I thought about Philosophy and animals in the same stream of thought. The kind which is small yet profound, the kind that gives you different food for thought every time you visit it.

Our desire to make sense of our time and place in the world and to make a meaningful contribution to it drives most of our actions. Different cultures and societies have different ideas about them. For some, it’s about pleasing God, for others, it's about living a good life, whatever that means, a life of virtues perhaps. For some, it’s the pursuit of knowledge, and for others, it’s about finding their true potential, exploring the limits of their body and mind. You could call it your Ikigai, or Dharma. Thoughts about meaning and purpose, of why we are here, consumes most of us at various times in our life. Sometimes so much that it pushes us over the mountain of uncertainty and leaves us rolling down helplessly and endlessly because the answers don’t come easy.

Looking at human concepts such as meaning, purpose, morality, and ethics through the lens of non-human animals is interesting because the framework of ideas we set for ourselves not only guides our relationships with, and attitudes towards, fellow humans but also with other elements of nature, living or not.

When we think of a dog as cute, we project our understanding of the world and assign the attribute of cuteness to it. With cuteness, we also, albeit unconsciously, associate other things like innocence and harmlessness, for example.

When one of the start-ups I worked for back in India shut down because of financial problems, I tagged along with one of the senior engineers in the team to build a prototype of an idea he had. We then went around on his motorbike and met with some of the investors he knew from his previous gig, to pitch the idea. Those rounds on his bike taught me more about him and his motivations and aspirations than a year working with him.

In one of the stops, we got off the bike and saw a dog sleeping on the street. It was a Saturday, but dogs don’t have Saturdays, do they? They have days.. and nights. They also probably don't have weird, random cultural notions about what they ought to be doing on certain days, at certain times, or with their life. It was mid-day and he was in the middle of a nap. Our arrival was an unwelcome change in his world. How do I know? He gave us a look that told us that. Turns out they are pretty good at giving non-verbal signals. Or maybe it was my interpretation of that. That's what I'd have said if somebody were to bother me during a good mid-day nap. It’s as they say, what we think of our experiences tells more about us than about the world. He walked a few yards away from us and continued what he was doing. I envy people, or in this case dogs, that can go back to sleep right away after having been woken up.

My friend looked at the dog and commented that he’d have preferred a dog’s life to a human’s. That way, he said, he didn’t have to worry about finding meaning in his life and didn’t have to be constantly worried about making life worthwhile.

At the time, I couldn’t feel what he felt. I wasn’t passionate about anything. I didn't have the drive that he did. Time, as far as I was concerned, was unlimited. I had the majority of my life ahead of me.

But what’s interesting about what he wondered is the collective arrogance it shows of humans towards other beings. Science and technology, while has helped us get ahead in the race of evolution, have also blinded us by the illusion of superiority. We're unnecessarily and pompously certain about things that we don't know, or can ever know, for sure.

I wonder, what if dogs actually thought about meaning and purpose? What if they are more aware of the fundamental nature of existence and were more willing to accept it than we are? What if they have figured out, like the existentialist philosophers, that nothing really matters and that life is absurd, and so they’re focusing on what’s in the present and what's important - to continue to live?

The other interesting thing about that is that it speaks to the dichotomy of pain and pleasure that comes from being driven. His passion and internal motivation to build something meaningful, to make an impact, was pushing him towards something that was hard, and uncomfortable, yet rewarding at the same time.

He felt the pain of spending all that time away from his kid and his then-pregnant wife, of life slipping away from his hands without him being present with his loved ones, but also was comforted from the feeling that comes from attending to the calling he heard from within. He'd have preferred an easier life if he could, but his drive left him no choice. I now know what that feels like.

So here he was working on an idea that could bring so-called meaning to his life, going around town on a motorbike with a young college graduate and wondering about all of it looking at a sleeping dog.

For a moment, my mind drifted away a little wondering about the dog.

Was he sleeping, dreaming, or meditating? Was he hanging out with his friends late last night? Was he physically exhausted, bored, or perhaps full of a heavy meal? What went through his mind when we woke him up? Did he silently swear at us?

The memory of this whole episode kept coming back to me at various times, in different situations, years later.

When I started to become interested in outdoor activities and got into running, hiking, and biking, I remember how I couldn’t get myself to do anything on the weekends but that. Even my day job took a backseat for a while. I focused less on my career and more on outdoor experiences. I thought, and read, about balance and free will but at the same time felt completely helpless in the grips of the inner force that was controlling me. It occurred to me how he, or most entrepreneurs, must feel like when they invest all their time, money, and energy into something risky, and when they believe that they are choosing to do it while knowing deep down that they are not in charge.

That leaves me with a few questions.

Was the dog freer in a sense than us, without being constantly crippled by the worries in life?

Would I have picked up the Philosophy book if that moment from my past didn’t leave such an imprint on me.. about Philosophy and dogs? If I wouldn’t have, then is it even true that I chose the book? Given the experiences that I had had, did I truly have the freedom to not choose it? If I didn't, then who's in charge? Is it possible that the book chose me instead?
