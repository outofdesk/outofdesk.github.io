**"I Tried"** -- That's what I think my tombstone should say. I'll not have a tombstone because my body will be burned in the funeral pyre, according to Hindu traditions, so my soul can rest in peace. But if I had one, I'd like it to say that. The statement accurately captures how I live my life, or at that point, how I'll have lived my life. I *try* to do the things to the best of my ability and I *try* to get better. I not only do that with the things I want to be good at, but also with those that others expect me to do. That’s right, I care a lot more about what people think than I like to admit. In the different roles I play -- a husband, a son, a brother, a friend, an engineer, a colleague, a runner, a hiker, a reader, a learner, a writer -- I *try* to perform well. Whether I'm successful in my attempts is a different question, and sometimes beyond my control, what is though, is *trying*. And so I do that.

Children are good at *trying*. Their curious minds and the lack of fear make for a good combination in helping them *try* without restraints. We gradually become more set in our ways as we grow up. While it's partly due to the lessened curiosity, the slowing of neuroplasticity, we blame the anatomy of brains more than it deserves. It's largely the fear of failure that holds us back. There's a negative connotation in society to *trying*. It's not assertive enough, or confident enough; it isn’t good enough. Heck, even the tools that help improve your English writing, like Grammarly, suggest not to hedge, when you use those words. The focus is more on the outcome than the act of *trying*. That's not to say that mere *trying* should be rewarded, no. But it could use a little good publicity. *Trying* is good and it needs to be treated as such. It's challenging but rewarding in the end. You learn things that you don't expect.

But *trying* is hard! Yes, it is. As they say, no good things in life come easy. Well, you might get lucky, but you will have a better chance of succeeding if you try.

But *trying* takes time! Yes, it does, but what doesn’t? Not *trying* also takes time!

There are a few episodes in the series Big Bang Theory where Sheldon corrects people that he didn’t merely *try* things, he succeeded at them. Being successful at something brings with it a sense of smugness that clouds our view of the humble beginnings of *trying*. That's especially true of people who haven't failed at things. It's hard to appreciate the beauty of *trying*, if all you've had are wins at the first attempt. I've always admired people who genuinely *try* to get better, be better. It's the lack of willingness to try, or feigning to *try* that I find repulsive.

I see people doing that with the act of listening. Often, people don't even *try*. They merely wait for others to finish so they can speak. That's probably the cause of the majority of arguments and fights -- people not *trying* to listen to others. I'm guilty of it myself. It's hard to always know it at the time you're doing it, but that's where reflecting on your actions and choices help. They help you rethink, reassess and *try* other things, in other ways. In this messy, complex and beautiful world of infinite choices, that's all we can do -- *try*.

That's my humble tribute to *trying*. I’d like to think that it’s an attempt to make *trying* look good, but it might just as well be something that I’m *trying* to convince myself of.
