In 2013, I was working in a startup with a team of about 10 engineers when one day, we were all called for a team meeting. The founders were in the meeting so we knew it was something important. We were informed that the company was shutting down due to lack of funding.

I had received admit a few days ago from one of the graduate schools I had applied to in the US and so I had a plan and two to three months of vacation ahead. One of the senior engineers in the team decided to work on his venture. Other people started looking for jobs, some founded their own companies too. He asked me if I would be willing to work with him to help build a POC(Proof of Concept). I had nothing to lose here. If it went well, I could always stay and potentially become a co-founder(yes, I passed that opportunity to go to graduate school!) or I could fly to the US in a few months and begin another new phase. It was a win-win for me.

He said he had savings to afford not having a job for up to a year and he knew a couple of people who could potentially invest in his idea. After we built a POC, we drove around to places on his motorbike, with our laptops and a “tea-and-biscuits” pitch.

One day after we parked the bike, he casually looked at a street dog sleeping on the road and told me something in Hindi(translated to English here): “We should have been born as those fucking street dogs. We didn’t have to worry so much about jobs or founding a company! We could just sleep all day.”

That to me was hilarious. Something about his tone, his facial expression, the casual delivery and the humor about his struggle made it really funny.

I think back on it and that episode seems profound.

1. *It tells something about human desire and imagination* - How we always seek meaning in our lives, how we have this power to create something new, and even the audacity to imagine what a dog’s life must be like!

2. *It tells about the attitude one can have even in difficult situations in life* - The fact that he said that signals his frustration and anxiety, but also his attitude to make something funny out of it, rather than brooding over the situation and do nothing

3. *It tells something about the stories, sometimes false narratives we tell ourselves to get through life, or in simpler terms, our ability to see the “grass always greener on the other side”* - How we think others’ lives are easy, and that it would be great if we could trade their lives with ours. But the thing is, the problems we have are the problems we created(most of the time) and the ones we can and should solve.

4. *The **drive** that almost robs us of free will and calls the shots in our lives* - His wife was pregnant at the time and with her parents, so he had a couple of months to completely devote himself to something. He had enough money to take a vacation, but he chose (or was forced by his drive) to struggle, and push himself to embark on a new and unknown journey.
