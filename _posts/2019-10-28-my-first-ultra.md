that meets the criterion is 50k, which is about 32 miles. The longest I had run so far was a 35k the year before, which is about 22.5 miles. So it looked like an ambitious, formidable, yet doable challenge. It was past the Labor Day weekend, so I had already lost the first week of September..."

It was in July this year that I went on a long bike ride with one of my friends. It was an annual race up in Colorado, the land of the fourteeners, as they are called, the mountain peaks that stand above 14000 ft from sea level. It was the longest ride I had ever done in a single day and it wasn't a flat one. It took us over three mountain passes, and so the event was aptly called the "Triple Bypass". That feeling that you get after challenging yourself, after pushing yourself to do something that you haven't done before, is special. It has a dual nature to it; it humbles you and at the same time instills confidence and courage in you. Humility comes from knowing the struggle of pursuing hard things, and confidence and courage come from knowing that you possess the discipline and drive to keep at it and emerge a little bit better.

After I came back home, I naturally got busy with the mundanity of each day. A feeling of emptiness started to creep up a few days later. It was a feeling that seemed vaguely familiar. It’s the hole left behind every time anything that’s important disappears from life. It has appeared before when I lost people near and dear to me, or when they went away. But this time it wasn’t a person that I lost but a feeling, a sense of progress and growth. The past few months that I spent training for the race provided me with the nourishment that I needed, both physically and mentally. Now, after the race, I had been riding the wave of a sense of accomplishment and hadn’t realized when it had carried me to the beach and left me stranded. Surfing on the tides of past accomplishments only lasts for so long. The emptiness that I was feeling appeared to be from the lack of goal, but it’s not strictly the goal that brings us joy and a sense of purpose, although we often think it does, but the pursuit of it. After talking to some of my friends about it, I’ve come to believe that this emptiness is more common than we realize. I think that it speaks to the comforts and luxuries in life that we have come to afford. Unlike my parents’ generation, most of our lives, fortunately, have gotten so easy that we are often not challenged enough to discover our potential. That partly explains why there’s a rise in the desire to travel and immerse ourselves in adventures in the most developed countries. When getting by your day is hard enough, there’s not much room to think about what lies outside of that bubble, and when it’s not hard at all, all you think of is what you’re missing.

A few more weeks passed by as I pushed these thoughts into the background and went about my life. The thought brewed in the subconscious and floated back to the surface of consciousness a few weeks later, in September. I was turning 30 in October, so running at least 30 miles seemed like an ambitious and fun challenge, something worth working towards. The shortest official distance that matches the criterion is 50k, which is about 32 miles. It also happens to be an ultra-marathon distance. And so the training began.

It was past the Labor Day weekend, so I had already lost the first week of September and since I wanted to do the race in the same month as my birthday, I had about 6-7 weeks to train. It seemed like a short time to go from 0 miles of running the whole year to 50k in a matter of a couple of weeks, so I had to start as soon as possible. I started the week after.

Below is what the training looked like in numbers(Thanks to Strava!).

If you're into long-distance running, you can tell that it looks like casual, weekday runs, nothing like training for an ultra at all. It's true. Having made plans for the weekends ahead with my family and friends, weekdays were all I could get. I tried to squeeze at least two runs per week during lunch time, with each run somewhere between 5-8 miles. The longest run was about 10.5 mi and that was three weeks before the race. Sometimes due to lack of time, and other times because of my laziness, I didn't go longer than that. And the runs were on flat roads, so I wasn't getting any elevation training either. I had to first build up to the distance, before I could climb up. The race had about 5k ft of gain and descent. The thought of that in addition to pounding the legs for that long, scared me. The last two weeks I ventured out to the hilly streets near my office in San Francisco and did some circuit runs to get my body used to uphill and downhill.

## Notes and Reflections
-----

1. The race had a no-cup policy, so I carried a Nathan water bottle with me in hand. I think that works better for me than carrying a hydration pack, which rubs my back and gets the shirt all wet

2. Chafing is the worst. Even now, days after the race, my nipples hurt just thinking about it. I think right around mile 13, I took off my shirt and carried it pretty much from there up to a few yards before the finish line. I should take better care of it next time! Vaseline helps I think but I should look into some strap that hugs it tight and doesn't cause friction.

3. Next time I sign up for something like this, I should do longer runs and on trails. That takes care of the boredom of long runs and also makes for a better training

4. You don't get bored in trail runs. I had prepared a playlist of workout music and motivating podcasts to keep me going, especially in the end. But one, I didn't need it and two, it ruins the fun of the race. When I slowed down in the last third of the race, I enjoyed the company of runners who were with me. Chatting with them, running with them helped me even speed up a little.

5. GU is delicious and works well, I think. It's really easy to eat on the go.
