While I was running yesterday, I found myself asking if I think while running or run while thinking. Unlike thinking, which goes on and off in the background, sometimes conscious other times not, running is deliberate and has a concrete start and stop to it. I guess there’s a philosophical argument that can be made that in some sense we’re all running towards something all the time, but that’s not the kind of running I’m talking, or I should say thinking, about. As much as I'd like my thinking also to be deliberate, I find out every time that thoughts can neither be summoned nor be directed at will. Well, I guess that's not completely true. They can be, but only when the mind relinquishes control over them and lets you drive. In other words, our minds are like auto-rickshaws in India -- if and when you catch hold of them is not up to you, it's up to the driver, but when you do, they'll humor you and go as you say for as long as they think they’re safe. Thoughts are the places you go to.

Minds have their hierarchy of needs. When the base ones have been met, they let you focus on things that are, while important, matter the least, relatively speaking.

For example, soon as I start running, the first few thoughts are about how my body is feeling. I can't help it. They just occur to me. This is what I call the “safety system” talking. *Are my glutes too tight? Are my knees hurting? Is my back too stiff? Is my form proper?*

They're followed by thoughts about the logistics of the run. This is the “optimization system” doing its job. *Am I going too fast, or slow? How long do I want to run? How long can I comfortably run, considering how much I ran yesterday? How much do I plan to run the rest of the week? What do I listen to? Do I have my tracker on?*

Running pace dictates how clearly I can think. Run too fast and the “safety system” kicks in, taking control back. Run too slow and the “optimization system” takes charge. The pace has to be in a sweet spot where both the systems are quiet and happy. That comfortable pace is different for everybody, and it changes over time, which I think is true not merely with running but with life. We all have a pace and a goal we are comfortable with but knowing what that is takes time and deliberate effort. My pace is probably faster than some, but surely slower than a lot of other people. As long as I'm enjoying the run and it’s serving the purpose I run for, it doesn't matter much. When you find that pace you hit a rhythm, at which point putting one leg in front of the other becomes as mechanical as pedaling a bike. Depending on how you’re feeling, that repetition can go on for as long as you want. That's when the mind decides that it's okay for you to take over and focus on what you want to think about.

When I think about thinking, "shower thoughts" come to mind. People often stumble upon good ideas while taking a shower. I have, too. But I feel like the five or ten minutes it takes me to finish one is not long enough to think through those ideas. It doesn't provide me the continuity required to go deep into anything, unless, of course, I stay there long enough to let the hot water wash away not just the dirt, but peel my skin along with it. Shower thoughts make for a good tweet or a good social media post. They can be smart, creative, and funny. Like people who scroll endlessly on the Internet glance at posts, bless them with a like or an emoji, and move on, so do you. You mentally “like” the idea, feel good about yourself and move on to the next thought. There's no dearth of such shower thoughts to scroll through.

One of the few times in the day I get uninterrupted alone time long enough to think through things is while running. Thinking while running gives me the time and focus to dig into them, peel the layers, connect different ideas and organize them. They give me the space and resources to play with the Lego pieces and build a concrete, stable structure. They help me better understand myself and the world around me. Thoughts on a run make for good long-form writing, and I say good because the amount of attention involved stands to benefit you in more than one way. At worst, you'll have spent time trying to understand the nuances of things, and you'll have emerged having learned something. At best, you'll have created something that others will find value in and will pay for with their time and attention, which is as valuable a currency as one can hope for.

I still don't have an answer to the question I started with but from running I have learned that the inquiry is more important and useful than where I end up with it. I now know more about the thoughts I have while running than when I started thinking about them, and I know that as long as I’m exercising my mental and physical muscles, I’m making progress.
