My name is Gaurav Ramesh. I work as a Software Engineer in the Bay Area and have been living in the U.S since 2013. I hail from Shimoga, a little town in the south of India, close to Bengaluru, the Silicon Valley of India.

Moving from the college town of Columbus, Ohio to working in the Bay Area feels very similar to my journey from studying in Shimoga to working in Bengaluru. The similarity is not just in the characterization of the places, but what they have to offer.One has simplicity, authenticity, and peace of mind, the other has opportunities for growth, so the internal journey has been one of going back and forth between the two in pursuit of a healthy mix of both.

Writing is one of the *many* things I want to get better at and with this blog, I hope to do more of it.

If you have any feedback on my writing or thoughts on anything you find on this blog, feel free to write to me on my email below.

### My Current Favorite Lines
<br/>

<blockquote>
Right now, chicksâ€™ beaks are being burned off in factory farms. <br/>
Right now, raccoons are chewing off their paws to escape from steel-jaw traps. <br/>
Right now, millions of rabbits, mice, and other animals are being abused in laboratories. <br/>
Right now, animals in circuses are being beaten backstage. <br/>
So, write now!
