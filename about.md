My name is Gaurav Ramesh. I work as a Software Engineer in the Bay Area and have been living in the U.S since 2013. I originally come from Shimoga, a little town in the south of India, close to Bengaluru, the Silicon Valley of India. The move from studying in Ohio to working in the Bay Area feels very similar to my journey from studying in Shimoga to working in Bengaluru, in terms of opportunities, exposure, and personal growth.

I believe in incremental change and progress and I try my best to make small changes that I think will constantly make me a little better over time. I believe that the little things we do every day: what we eat, how we work, what we read, who we talk to, how much we sleep, what we think about, what we learn, how and what we choose, who we surround ourselves with, what we do with our time, how much we exercise - matter a lot in the long-term, way more than focused, intense bouts of change.
