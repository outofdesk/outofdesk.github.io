It's weird writing an *about me* page. If you're always learning and growing, what is it that makes you *you*? I mean, when I look at my previous blogs and how I described myself, I feel a little embarrassed about how silly and irrelevant they quickly become. So, while writing this, I had to think about not what I am at this point or this phase in life but about the fundamental qualities that haven't quite changed over time. I think that makes me *me*. So here are a few things about me, that have not and hopefully will not change.

*****

My name is Gaurav Ramesh. I work as a Software Engineer in the Bay Area and have been living in the U.S since 2013. I hail from Shimoga, a little town in the south of India, close to Bengaluru, the Silicon Valley of India. The move from studying in Ohio to working in the Bay Area feels very similar to my journey from studying in Shimoga to working in Bengaluru, in terms of opportunities, exposure, and personal growth.

I believe in incremental change and progress and try to make small changes that will constantly make me a little better over time. I believe that the little things we think and do every day matter a lot more in the long-term than focused, intense bouts of change.

I consider myself a curious person by nature and like to learn new things. Since 2016, when I first started hiking, I've been drawn a lot towards outdoor activities and have subsequently gotten into backpacking, running and biking. I also spend a significant amount of time reading. 

Of the *many* things I want to get better at, writing is one and with this blog, I hope to do more of it.

If you have any feedback on my writing or thoughts on anything you find on this blog, feel free to write to me on my email below.
