My name is Gaurav Ramesh. I work as a Software Engineer in the Bay Area and have been living in the U.S since 2013. I originally come from Shimoga, a little town in the south of India, close to Bengaluru, the Silicon Valley of India. The move from studying in Ohio to working in the Bay Area feels very similar to my journey from studying in Shimoga to working in Bengaluru, in terms of opportunities, exposure, and personal growth.

I believe in incremental change and progress and try my best to make small changes that I think will constantly make me a little better over time.
And I believe that the little things we think/do every day matter a lot more in the long-term than focused, intense bouts of change.
