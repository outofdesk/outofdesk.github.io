My name is Gaurav Ramesh. I work as a Software Engineer in the Bay Area and have been living in the U.S since 2013. I originally come from Shimoga, a little town in the south of India, close to Bengaluru, the Silicon Valley of India. The move from studying in Ohio to working in the Bay Area feels very similar to my journey from studying in Shimoga to working in Bengaluru, in terms of opportunities, exposure, and personal growth.

I believe in incremental change and progress and try my best to make small changes that will constantly make me a little better over time. And I believe that the little things we think and do every day matter a lot more in the long-term than focused, intense bouts of change.

I consider myself a curious person by nature and like to learn new things. Since 2016, when I first starting hiking, I've been drawn more towards outdoor activities and have subsequently gotten into backpacking, running and biking.

One of the many things I want to get better at is writing and with this blog, I hope to do more of it. I'm also going to resist the temptation to look back at my writing, criticize it and take down the blog!

If you have any feedback on my writing or thoughts on anything you find on this blog, feel free to write to me on my email below.
